# 👨‍💼 Employee Analytics Using SQL & Tableau

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a multi-table HR database using SQL to extract key business insights and visualize them in Tableau. The dataset used is a simulated enterprise employee database (`employees.sql`) consisting of over 10 interconnected tables.

The objective was to generate actionable HR KPIs such as total headcount, salary trends, top earners, gender distribution, and department-wise metrics to support data-driven workforce decisions.
